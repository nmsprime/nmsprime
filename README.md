## Architectural Concepts

NMS Prime is based on the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) Framework and uses [PHP 7](https://php.net) for the Back-End and a modern and responsive [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) Theme for the Front-End.

It is tested and developed under CentOS 7 (RHEL 7).

NMS Prime is build with standard Linux tools, like
- [ISC DHCP](https://www.isc.org/downloads/dhcp/) for IPv4
- [Kea](https://www.isc.org/kea/) for IPv6
- [Named](https://linux.die.net/man/8/named)
- [Icinga](https://icinga.com/)
- [Cacti](https://www.cacti.net/index.php)

These tools are actively developed, approved and used. See [Design Architecture](https://devel.roetzer-engineering.com/confluence/display/NMS/Architecture+Guidelines) for more information.
